Hello ðŸ‘‹ , my name is Victor Javier Amaya and I am currently a graduate student 
in Systems Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH).

A bit of me: 
I am a 21-year-old young man from a small town called La Union - Olancho - Honduras, 
I arrived in the big city with my suitcases and my little box of food, carrying all 
my dreams and the hopes of my parents, who bet all their life, because I became a professional.
I love photography and music, I have been playing drums since I was 10 years old.

âš¡ Technologies:
- Python - Java - Sql - JavaScript - TypeScript - Php - Html - Css - React - .ENV - Bootstrap - Nodejs - Express - Typeorm - React Native - Nodemon - Expo -jQuery

ðŸ˜„ I don't really care about money, I love learning, and I love what I do.

The mantra by which I govern my life: "If I have seen further it is because I am sitting on the shoulders of giants" -Isaac Newton
